## Hi, I'm Tyler Wade

* I've been coding for over 5 years. Primarily in Java and JavaScript.
* I'm the founder of [Guided Gospel](https://guidedgospel.net)
* You can check out my portfolio at [Tyler Wade.net](https://tylerwade.net)

I'm a software engineer with over 5 years of programming experience, specializing in web development and backend systems. My journey began in high school, sparked by a passion for video games, where I first learned Python in the classroom and experimented with C# and Unity at home.

While game development introduced me to the world of code, I found a deeper interest in building scalable and efficient web applications. Since then, I've focused on backend development using technologies like Java Spring Boot, Node.js, AWS, and continue to grow my expertise across the software development stack.
