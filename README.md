## Hi, I'm Tyler Wade

* I've been coding for over 5 years. Primarily in JavaScript and Java.
* I'm the founder of [Guided Gospel](https://guidedgospel.net)
* You can check out my portfolio at [Tyler Wade.net](https://tylerwade.net)

I've been programming since I was a freshman in High School. Growing up I was a big fan of video games, and I always wanted to learn how to make them myself. So I got started with python at school, and C# and Unity at home. Although I love making video games, I came to find out I love web development more! I wanted to create something unique that people could genuinely use. That's when I founded Guided Gospel, a Christian based AI web hub, where users can ask their questions and get bible based guidance within seconds. Alongside that they can utilize the built in tools and features to help in their faith journey.

## For my Guided Gospel Users:
Guided Together is in the works! Guided Together is a hub where users can interact and communicate with each and share ideas. It's a great way to bring our community together! Guided Together will be implemented in your favorite application Guided Gospel, so you can continue to have all your Faith Tools in the same place! There's more coming, but you'll have to wait for that...!
